Text: Hi there, I’m Andrea, born 1983. I live and work in St. Gallen Switzerland. I make objects and furniture from different materials but mostly from wood and urushi. In 2000 I started a 4 year long apprenticeship as a Polymechanican. My first journey to Japan 2004 has awoken the interest in Urushi and Japanese furniture design. That was when it all started.
