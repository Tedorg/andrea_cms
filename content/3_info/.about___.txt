Andrea Ruegger is an Urushi $Artist based in St.Gallen Switzerland.

He has its origins in the Edo period and the efforts of one Tamakaji Zokoku, who embarked on an in-depth study of Chinese and other Asian lacquer techniques and came up with a number of original techniques that went on to form the foundation of Sanuki lacquerwork.
Thanks then to the generous patronage of generations of the Matsudaira rulers of Takamatsu, the region produced a stream of superlative lacquer artists and lacquer merchants. Sanuki lacquer has developed even further in the modern era, and five decorative techniques: kinma, zonsei, choshitsu, goto-nuri and zokoku-nuri, are now officially designated examples of traditional Japanese craftwork. Sanuki lacquer is versatile, with craftsmen creating products for a staggering variety of everyday uses, from accessories to furniture and household goods.
Lacquer is integral to life in Kagawa: the prefecture even has its own institute for the study of lacquer, established in 1954 to train the young craftsmen and women key to the future of Sanuki lacquerwork. Lacquer art is also taught at Kagawa Prefectural Takamatsu-Kougei High School.
